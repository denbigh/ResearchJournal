# Week Starting February 6

## Monday
### Start of Day

I'm going to try out a new format for a research journal today. Every day, I'll 
start with plans for the day, and then I'll recap at the end of the day. We'll 
see how it goes.

There is one task I need to do today: I need to run some validation tests on our 
absorber column model. Ideally I will aim to do this around lunch time, in case 
Wenqin needs figures/slides for the presentation at 8am tomorrow.

Otherwise, I plan to work on the peer review response for our Joule paper. The 
bulk of the text is in place - now we need to change the manuscript itself. I 
will see if we can cancel the dimensional analysis discussion to free up some 
time for this.

### End of Day
